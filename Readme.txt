These codes are for D0 RPA Analysis: 


DfinderAnalysis is used to create Dfinder and Dntuple. The codes to create Dfinder is at Bfinder/crab and create Dntuple are at Bfinder/Bfinder/Dntuple

For Dfinder, we implement costhetastar for Track 1 and Track 2, which are very powerful to  select D0 candidates for D0 pT < 2 GeV/c

There are two types of Codes in Dntuple. One is For lxplus which is just in Dntuple folder. The other one is FprCondor, which is for submit.mit.edu

Make Plots is the code to make plots of cut parameters of Data and Monte Carlo to decide which cut parameters are useful. 

For TMVA, we can use it to study the cut parameters of Low pT D0 and generate the ROC plot to decide which cut parameters we should use

DntupleRpPb is basically the code to get the DRPA for all pT

Fitting is a code created to fit the D0 invariant mass distribution and extract the D^0 Yield  

Systematics contains the code to study the systematic uncertainty of D0 RPA. pdfVariation is the code to study the systematic error for with different fitting functions for D0 Yield Distribution.
